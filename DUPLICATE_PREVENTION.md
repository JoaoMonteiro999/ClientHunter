# 🛡️ Duplicate Email Prevention Feature

## Overview
ClientHunter now automatically prevents sending duplicate emails to the same recipients, ensuring you don't spam your prospects and maintain a professional outreach approach.

## How It Works

### 📝 Automatic Tracking
- Every successfully sent email is logged in `sent_emails_log.json`
- The log tracks: email address, company name, language, and timestamp
- Before sending any email, the system checks if it was already sent

### 🔍 Smart Filtering
- **Language-Specific:** Tracks emails per language (you can send PT and EN to the same person)
- **Company-Aware:** Remembers which company each email was associated with
- **Timestamp:** Records exactly when each email was sent

### 📊 Statistics & Management
- View sent email statistics in the Streamlit interface
- See how many unique recipients you've contacted
- Track emails sent by language
- Clear history if needed (with confirmation)

## Features

### In the Streamlit App:
- **📊 Sent Emails History** section shows:
  - Total unique recipients
  - Total emails sent
  - Breakdown by language
- **Real-time filtering** during campaigns
- **Clear History** button (with safety confirmation)

### Command Line Tools:
```bash
# Show statistics
python email_sender.py --stats

# Check if a specific email was sent
python email_sender.py --check email@example.com

# Clear all sent email history
python email_sender.py --clear
```

## Campaign Behavior

### What You'll See:
1. **Before sending:** System shows how many emails are new vs. already sent
2. **During campaign:** Only new emails are sent, duplicates are skipped
3. **Progress tracking:** Accurate progress based on emails actually being sent
4. **Final report:** Summary of sent vs. skipped emails

### Example Output:
```
📊 Total de emails no arquivo: 100
✅ Emails novos para enviar: 75
⏭️ Emails já enviados (pulados): 25

📋 Emails que serão pulados:
   ⏭️ Dental Clinic ABC (info@dentalclinic.com) - enviado em 2025-07-29 14:30:15
   ...

🎉 CONCLUÍDO!
📊 Emails enviados: 75/75 (novos)
⏭️ Emails pulados (já enviados): 25
📁 Total no arquivo: 100
```

## File Structure
```
sent_emails_log.json - The main log file (auto-created)
{
  "email@example.com": [
    {
      "company": "Example Corp",
      "language": "en",
      "timestamp": "2025-07-29T14:30:15.123456",
      "date": "2025-07-29 14:30:15"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 🎯 Recommended Workflow:
1. **First campaign:** Run normally, all emails will be sent
2. **Follow-up campaigns:** System automatically skips previous recipients
3. **Different languages:** You can send PT version to someone who received EN
4. **Periodic cleanup:** Use stats to monitor your outreach volume

### ⚠️ When to Clear History:
- Starting a completely new campaign cycle
- Changing your email template significantly
- After a long period (e.g., 6+ months)
- When re-targeting is appropriate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Log file corrupted:** Delete `sent_emails_log.json` to reset
- **Import errors:** Make sure all files are in the same directory
- **Permission issues:** Ensure write access to the app directory

### Recovery:
If the log file gets corrupted, the system will automatically create a new one and continue working normally.
